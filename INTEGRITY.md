# Integrity Statement

This assignment was completed as an individual take-home exercise.

I approached the problem by first understanding the data and threat model, then incrementally building exploratory analysis, feature engineering, detection logic, evaluation and packaging. Emphasis was placed on reasoning, interpretability and realistic security trade-offs rather than maximizing performance metrics alone.

I relied on official documentation and reference material, including:
- Python standard library documentation
- pandas and scikit-learn documentation
- Docker documentation
- StackOverflow for resolving specific error messages and implementation issues

All code, analysis and documentation were written and executed manually. No external codebases or pre-built solutions were copied wholesale. All results, conclusions and design decisions reflect my own understanding and implementation.

I am prepared to explain, justify and modify any part of the codebase during a follow-up interview or live discussion.
